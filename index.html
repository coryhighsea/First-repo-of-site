		<p>I have created this site to develope my website building skills. I will slowly improve the site with new techniques as I learn them. I want to eventually build the site with React, having interactive sections. For right know I have built it with html and css. I am learning JavaScript and JQuery to implement it as well. Eventually I would like to have a currency converter along with other apps that I will create and think of. Right now I have written a couple of blog posts. I was living in Germany for 8 months and I just returned to Canada. I plan on travelling in the future and would like to have some interesting content. I will have a few blog posts but the focus of this site will be to show the development of the site.</p>

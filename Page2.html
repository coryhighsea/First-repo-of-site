	<h2>How to Win Friends and Influence People</h2>
	<hr/>
	<p>If you have not heard of this book I would suggest to look into it. It was published in 1936 and was written by Dale Carnegie. I have had two copies because the first one got destroyed. I have read it two or three times. It's a book that I travel with and will alway keep it in my pack. I don't read it much lately but I still try and remember the concepts. I would say it is may favorite book of all time.</p>
	<p> The basic concept of the book is to allow other people to talk about themselves. Don't interupt them saying how you did that once too but better. To actually allow the person you are having a conversation with to really express themselves. Ask them questions about things they are interested. This will allow for a good flow of conversation. I also like to ask challening questions to new people I meet. For example, what is your dream job? Or what are your goals in the next few years? I find this really engages people.</p>
	<p> I say quite often, that my favorite part of traveling is meeting people from all over the world. Being able to have meaningful conversations with them makes it that much better of an experience.</p>
